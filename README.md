# Grammar Fixer

### A simple script to fix grammar follies.


Often when I write, I forget to capitalize "i" , forget to use apostrophes etc, so I made this little scrip to fix them ..

Features

- Takes one file as args . (use some shell magic to include more)
- Has a dict of words to replace..
- Replaces in place.
- Creates a backup file when replacing, un-comment marked code to remove backup automatically, if you want.
